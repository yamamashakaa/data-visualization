    "> The analysis highlights several trends in bike usage among subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers take significantly more rides than non-subscribers, with most rides taken by individuals aged 30 to 40. The average ride lasts six minutes and is typically under one hour. Interestingly, non-subscribers tend to spend longer on a single ride compared to subscribers, who often use bikes for shorter journeys. Thursdays see the highest number of rides, while weekends experience the least activity. There is a direct relationship between age and ride duration for those under 50, but this reverses after age 50, with older individuals spending less time on rides. The age distribution for both genders is similar, with most individuals aged under 44. Many riders with unspecified gender are non-subscribers, indicating a reluctance to provide complete information. Lastly, there are more male subscribers than female subscribers.\n",

    "> The Ford GoBike dataset is a collection of data related to bike-sharing rides in the San Francisco Bay Area. It includes information about the usage patterns of bikes provided by Ford GoBike, a bike-sharing service, and typically contains various attributes that describe each ride. The dataset has records for 183412 individual rides and 16 different features.  \n",

    "1. Number of rides taken by subscribers is way more than rides taken by customers who do not have subscription\n",

    "3. The majority of rides lasts less than one hour. 6 miniutes is the average of rides\n",
    "4. Unsubscribed customers (non-members) tend to spend a longer duration on a single ride compared to subscribers. This suggests that subscribers typically use the bike for any journey even if it is short, while non-members often take the bike for long rides.\n",

    "7.The age distribution for males and females is quite similar. Fifty percent of males are under 37 years old, while fifty percent of females are under 35 years old. Additionally, 75% of males fall under the age of 44, compared to 75% of females who are under 42\n",
